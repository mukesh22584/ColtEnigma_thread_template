* I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed.
* Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM before flashing it! 
* YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you blame me in any way for what happens to your device, I will laugh at you.

[U][B][SIZE="4"]What's ColtOS[/U][/B][/SIZE]

ColtOS Project is presented by a team of learners and it is crafted from AOSP Source with all the necessary customizations, without compromising the stability and security of the device.
We have cherry-picked the features from many other roms/projects and we are very thankful to all of them!! We just crossed the Beta Phase for Oreo and are happy to announce the release of Colt-OS Andy10 based on Android 10.0
Although there's no bugs experienced by us or testers, if you find any, please let us know with a logcat.

We would like to give thanks to everyone that contributes to the Android community, big or small because every bit counts. Although we can't list each and every contributor within the Android community, we would like to highlight some of the teams and individuals that have made it possible NOT only with just this version of COLT but throughout the years because we don't ever want to forget where we came from nor those that have helped us!

That said, ColtOS team would like to THANK to....
